Some short notes:

1. In order to keep the shopping cart "balanced", there is some/too much DRY in this lab. 
   Not yet been  able to extract Authentication check to a seperate service, and/or blazor component.
   Maybe not doable in a Blazor Web Assembly app?! 

2. Paypal coding is a mess, especially in combination with .NET. No uptodate information/examples anywhere. 
   No donation, purchased product(s) need to be handled/controlled/verified by a server. 
   Finally got the paypal script to open up the Check Out form, however yet to find a way to populate amount.value dynamically.


3. Up to the point of ordering, everything should work. Sometimes side navbar does not get loaded correctly, esp. during development.


4. Orders - Haven't worked with CQRSpattern before, pretty nice structure. API works, GUI Orders left to implement. 


5. Download and Run Instructions -

A) Download, extract, rebuild to check everything is working.

B) You might have to run these commands - and dont forget to adjust SqlServer Connection settings if so (and to remove old migrations folder first!).

   Adjusting settings done via Dependencies inside Project Shopping.Infrastructure and AppSettings inside Project Shopping.Api

   Commands - Package Manager Console - if needed: 

   Add-Migration InitialProd -Context ProductContext -StartupProject Shopping.Api -OutputDir Migrations/Prod

   Update-Database -Context ProductContext -StartupProject Shopping.Api

   Add-Migration InitialAppId -Context AppIdentityDbContext -StartupProject Shopping.Api -OutputDir Migrations/AppId

   Update-Database -Context AppIdentityDbContext -StartupProject Shopping.Api


C) Set as multiple start-up projects from solution explorer, API on top and Shopping.Web.Portal below.

D) There are 2 initial Users seeded, but u can try registering one, TestUser@hotmail.com for instance.

E) Ctrl F5.

F) Note: if you register as a new user in Development, you will be given "Administrator" role by default. 
   Change this to "StandardUser" in AccountController/Registration, or something else(see db for all roles seeded).
