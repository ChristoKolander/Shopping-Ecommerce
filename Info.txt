Some short notes:

1. 
Paypal coding is a mess, especially in combination with .NET. No uptodate information/examples anywhere. 
This is not just a donate situation where the user decides amount, so purchased product(s) need to be handled/controlled/verified by a server. 
Finally got the paypal script to open up the Check Out form, however yet to find away to populate amount.value dynamically.


2.
Up to the point of ordering, everything should work. Sometimes side navbar does not get loaded correctly, esp.
during debugging. But fixed the issue of adding an item already in the basket. User only gets redirect to
shoppingcart, no message provided. Overkill.

3.
Orders: Should be working in terms of API-functionality. Haven't worked with CQRSpattern before, so leave it as is for now.
Only GUI left to implement!
