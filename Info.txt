Some short notes:

1. 
Paypal coding is a mess, especially in combination with .NET. No uptodate information/examples anywhere. 
Amount for purchased product(s) need to be handled/verified by server. This is not just a donate situation 
where the user decides the amount...But finally got the paypal script to open up the Check Out form. 

However, yet to find away to populate amount.value dynamically.


2.
Up to the point of ordering, everything should work. Sometimes side navbar does not get loaded correctly, esp.
during debugging. But fixed the issue of adding an item already in the basket. User only gets redirect to
shoppingcart, no message provided. Overkill.

3.
Finally at the point starting to work with orders.
