Some short notes:

1. 
Paypal coding is a mess, especially in combination with .NET. No uptodate information/examples anywhere. 
And the solution/example provided by online course turned out not
to be applicable at all. After some research found out the obvious; amount for purchased product(s) need to be 
handled/verified by server. This is not just a donate situation where the user decides the amount.
In other words: a lot of code needs to be written for this process.
...But finally got the paypal script to open up the form. 

However, yet to find away to populate amount.value dynamically.

No experience in JavaScript...

2.
Up to the point of ordering, everything should work. Sometimes side navbar does not get loaded correctly, esp.
during debugging. But fixed the issue of adding an item already in the basket. User only gets redirect to
shoppingcart, no message provided. Overkill.

3.
Finally at the point starting to work with orders.
