Some short notes:

1. 
Paypal coding is a mess, especially in combination with .NET. No uptodate information/examples anywhere. 
This is not a donate situation where the user decides amount, so purchased product(s) need to be handled/controlled/verified by a server. 
Finally got the paypal script to open up the Check Out form, however yet to find a way to populate amount.value dynamically.


2.
Up to the point of ordering, everything should work. Sometimes side navbar does not get loaded correctly, esp.
during debugging, but fixed the issue of adding an item already in the basket. User only gets redirect to
shoppingcart, no message provided. Overkill.

3.
Orders: Should be working in terms of API-functionality and CQRS. Haven't worked with CQRSpattern before, so leave it as is for now.
Only GUI left to implement! 


Download and Run Instructions:

1. Download, extract, rebuild to check everything is working.

2. You might have to run these commands - and dont forget to adjust SqlServer Connection settings if so (and to remove old migrations folder first!).

Adjusting settings done via Dependencies inside Project Shopping.Infrastructure and AppSettings inside Project Shopping.Api

Commands - Package Manager Console - if needed: 

Add-Migration InitialProd -Context ProductContext -StartupProject Shopping.Api -OutputDir Migrations/Prod

Update-Database -Context ProductContext -StartupProject Shopping.Api

Add-Migration InitialAppId -Context AppIdentityDbContext -StartupProject Shopping.Api -OutputDir Migrations/AppId

Update-Database -Context AppIdentityDbContext -StartupProject Shopping.Api


3. Set as multiple start-up projects from solution explorer, API on top and Shopping.Web.Portal below.
4. There are 2 initial Users seeded, but u can try registering one, TestUser@hotmail.com for instance.
5. Ctrl F5.
6. Note: if you register as a new user in Development, you will be given "Administrator" role by default. 
Change this to "StandardUser" in AccountController/Registration, or something else(see db for all roles seeded).
