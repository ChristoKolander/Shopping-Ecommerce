In order to avoid code duplication when it comes to authentication,
the login method has to force a reload of the MainLayout.razor component;

The AuthSolution Component is - like the CartMenu Component - injected into
the shared MainLayout.razor file. This prevents ProductsBase.cs and ProductDetails.cs
from having to run the exact same code.
