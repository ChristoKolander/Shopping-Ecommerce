Too much duplicate code in these services. Refactoring when time.

Same of course goes for handling the state of authentication, but
could not get it to work extracting it to a seperate class/service. Not sure,
but seems like it can only function properly directly connected to a blazor
component where the user is located.

Another issue is to implement logic not storing empty carts in db,
which is the case right now. And they need to be there in order to 
connect to LocalStorage. One advantage of keeping notloggedin carts
in db is business - but maybe we can track customer usage without having 
empty carts in db? In the end, maybe not so difficult to to delete
all carts and all settings in LocalStorage and DB if cart empty when
customer is "sessionized".
