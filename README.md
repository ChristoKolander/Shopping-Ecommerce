# Shopping Ecommerce

A) Testsite - trying out different approaches and techniques!

Blazor Web Assembly upfront - but you could easily add another frontend solution, Angular for instance.

Code is not for production.

Just lab.

Upgradepath: from 3.1 to .Net 6 -> .NET9

Read Info.txt inside each project for more details.

B)

Download and test the code: Visual Studio 2022.

Download Instructions: See folder Solution Items, info.txt step 5.

Note: Hard to find material on how to implement a disconnected shopping cart solution. Started out as a Blazor Web Assembly introduction project, and ended up as back-end focused test project.
