This is a private Repo. 
Using Net.Core 3.1

Code is not for production. 
Just trying out some ideas...

If You want to try out this code live - instead of downloading - go to:

To use admin priveligies, log in as TestUser1@hotmail.com, and use this password: "".

Feel free to try out funcionality, either as admin, standardUser or Manager, or unauthorized user.

If you want to download and try out the code:

1. Download, extract, rebuild to check it works.
2. Insert DB connectionstring in Appsettings.json and adjust Start.cs - on the wep api.
3. Run Update-database from package-manager - it should (!) work.
5. Run.
