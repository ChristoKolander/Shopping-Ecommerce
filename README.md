# Shopping Ecommerce

A)


This is a private Repo... 

Testsite - trying out different approaches and techniques!

Blazor Web Assembly upfront - but you could easily add another front end solution, Angular for instance.

Code is not for production. 

Just lab.

Recently upgraded from 3.1 to .Net 6.

Order implementation done at API level, using CQRS pattern - which I just found out I like. 

GUI for Order left to do.

B)

If you want to try out this code live - instead of downloading - go to: NotImplementedYet!

C)

If you want to download and test the code you will have to use Visual Studio 2022.

Download Instructions: info.txt at Solution root level folder Solution Items.
  
Note: Hard to find material on how to implement a disconnected shopping cart solution, which wasn't my original intention - I like back end a little bit more - but this is my initial approach. If you as an Employeer/Developer have some thoughts or alternative ways on how to keep a loosely front-end shoppingcart uptodate,
userfriendly, feel free to contact me.
