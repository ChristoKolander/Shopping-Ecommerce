# Shopping Ecommerce

A)

This project is not maintained. 

Testsite - trying out different approaches and techniques!

Blazor Web Assembly upfront - but you could easily add another frontend solution, Angular for instance.

Code is not for production.

Just lab.

Upgradepath: from 3.1 to .Net 6.

Read Info.txt inside each project for more details.

B)

If you want to try out this code live - instead of downloading - go to: NotImplementedYet!

C)

If you want to download and test the code you will have to use Visual Studio 2022.


Download Instructions: Info.txt step 5 at Solution root level inside folder Solution Items.

Note: Hard to find material on how to implement a disconnected shopping cart solution, which wasn't my original intention - I like back end a little bit more - but this is my initial approach. If you as an Employeer/Developer have some thoughts or alternative ways on how to keep a loosely front-end shoppingcart uptodate, userfriendly, feel free to contact me.
