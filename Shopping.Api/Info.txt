1. Dependencies  - 

   Core, Infrastructure, Shared

2. Attributes - 
 
   Using a ValidationFilterAttribute for model validation inside the Account Controller. 

2. Automapper - 

   Not a big fan from the start, but later on got lazy and used to it.

2. Controllers - 

   Using Dtos for most data transfers - not for Cart though. 

2. CQRS - NOTE THAT ORDERS AND CONNECTED ORDERCONTROLLER IS NOT ASSOCIATED TO THE VISUAL BLAZOR 
   IMPLEMENTATION AND THE SHOPPINGCART ETC - just testing out CQRS db access technique by using
   SWAGGER. Not all files are used.

2. Extensions - 

   a) Global errorhandling configured
   b) Search extension on products
   c) Testing to make Program.cs a little cleaner by extracting/adding some service registrations here. 
      Too much added, and it would not run properly though.

2. Logging - 

   Implementing logging using NLog. 

2. Security - 

   Rolebase authorization model PLUS policy too in order to get some granularity for special cases.

2. StaticFiles- 

   Files/Pictures uploaded for new Products created are stored here for the moment. 

2. SwaggerOptions - 

   Some Swagger Settings extracted to here, keeping Program.cs a little bit smaller.

3. Program.cs - 

   a) .NET 9 version - no startup class. Upgraded from .NET 6 just recently (2024-12-10), and it seems to work. 

   b) Region Builder and NLog - 

   Needed to configure logging even before configuring the host. Could not get it to work otherwise.
   Using NLog as provider, writing to file.
   ClearProviders() removes the built in logging provided by Microsoft.

  c) Region Cors - 

   Not configured for production, way too forgiving. Just adding it getting things to work!


  d) Region SwaggerStuff - 

   A lot of settings getting it to work. 


  e) Region Request PipeLine - 

   Order matters. Got this to work, so not changeing it !



5. <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"> - 

   Did NOT enable checks for nulls.
