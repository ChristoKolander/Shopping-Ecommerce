1. Dependencies  - 

   Core, Infrastructure, Shared

2. Attributes - 
 
   Using a ValidationFilterAttribute for model validation inside the Account Controller. 

2. Automapper - 

   Not a big fan from the start, but later on got lazy and used to it.

2. Controllers - 

   Using Dtos for most data transfers - not for Cart though. We could scale these down to a mininmum, but leave as is for now.

2. CQRS - Note again that this part is not connected to the UI. You have to use Swagger in order
   to create, get Products etc.

2. Extensions - 

   a) Global errorhandling configured
   b) Search extension on products
   c) Extracting/adding some service registrations here. 
      Too much added, and it would not run properly though.

2. Logging - 

   Implementing logging using NLog. Not yet fully compatitble 2024-12-12 to .NET version 9 - but seems to work.

2. Security - 

   3 levels: claims, roles, special requirement. 

     Saving the SuperAdmins requirement code for future use, commented.
 

2. StaticFiles- 

   Files/Pictures uploaded for new Products created are stored here for the moment. Initial seed stored inside wwwroot 
   Web.Portal.

2. SwaggerOptions - 

   Some Swagger Settings extracted to here, keeping Program.cs a little bit smaller.

3. Program.cs - 

   a) .NET 9 version - no startup class. Upgraded from .NET 6 just recently (2024-12-10), and it seems to work. 

   b) Region Builder and NLog - 

   Needed to configure logging even before configuring the host. Could not get it to work otherwise.
   Using NLog as provider, writing to file.
   ClearProviders() removes the built in logging provided by Microsoft.

  c) Region Cors - 

   Not configured for production, way too forgiving. Just adding it getting things to work!


  d) Region SwaggerStuff - 

   A lot of settings - cumbersome. 


  e) Region Request PipeLine - 

   Order matters. Got this to work, so not changeing it !



5. <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"> - 

   Did NOT enable checks for nulls on a global level.
