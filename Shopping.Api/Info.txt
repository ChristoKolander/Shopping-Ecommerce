Info Api Project

1. Dependencies  - 

   Core, Infrastructure, Shared

2. Attributes - 
 
   Don't think ValidationFilterAttribute adds enough value to this project.

2. Automapper - 

   Not a big fan right now. Does not save much writing.

2. Controllers - 

   Using Dtos for most - not for Cart YET. Need to address this.

2. CQRS - 

   Pattern used for just Orders. Not all files are used.

2. Extensions - 

   Global errorhandling, a search extension on products, and testing to make Program.cs
   a little cleaner by adding some service registrations here. Too much added, and it would not
   run properly though.

2. Logging - 

   Implementing logging using NLog.

2. Security - 

   Complex authorization policy.

2. StaticFiles- 

   Files uploaded stored here for the moment.

2. SwaggerOptions - 

   Some Swagger Settings extracted to here, keeping Program.cs a little bit smaller.

3. Program.cs - 

   .NET 6 version - no startup class. 

4. Region Builder and NLog - 

   Need to configure logging even before configuring the host? Could not get it to work otherwise.
   Using NLog as provider, no writing to file just using built in Microsoft logging providers.
   I usually add logging early in dev. process since it adds more details when writing to file, debugging.



4. Region Cors - 

   Not really configured for production. Just adding it getting things to work.


4. Region SwaggerStuff - 

   A lot of settings getting it to work. 


4. Region Request PipeLine - 

   Order matters. Got this to work, so not changeing it !



5. <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"> - 

   did not enable checks for null.
