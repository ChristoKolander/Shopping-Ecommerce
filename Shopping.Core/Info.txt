Info Core Project 

Last updated: 2024-12-12

1. Dependencies - 

   As you can see there's a dependency on the Shared Project because 2 DTOs are needed for
   interface construction: CartItemToAddDto and CartItemQtyUpdateDto. Since these also are needed at the GUI
   level I felt keeping them inside Shared Project made sense.  
  
   ( Maybe change around later, getting a better seperation between dif. projects.)

2. Design - 

   At the moment, Core basically is a flat storage for domain entities and needed stuff.

3. Entities - 

   No validation added! This is done via DTOs stored inside Shared Project. 

4. Interfaces - 

   IRepositoryBase contains a generic approach to declare interfaces for both synchronous 
   and asynchronous implementation. Its value can be discussed, but should the Solution
   grow in size, some declarations might come in handy. So I am keeping them for further use/
   refactoring.
   
   The IRepositoryWrapper Interface is NOT used at the moment.
