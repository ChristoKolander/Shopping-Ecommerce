Info Core Project 

1. Dependencies - 

   As you can see there's a dependency on the Shared Project because 2 DTOs are needed for
   interface construction: CartItemToAddDto and CartItemQtyUpdateDto. Since these also are needed at the GUI
   level I felt keeping them inside Shared Project made sense. 

   On those lines I also added OrderDto and OderItemDto to this Core Project - needed for the Address Class inside
   this Core Project. This keeps the Shared Project totally independent. 

2. Design - 

   At the moment, Core basically is a flat storage for domain entities and needed stuff, not a lot of
   domain logic - if any. So you can't really say it's a DDD pattern. But maybe I'll get there moving on... 

3. Entities - 

   No validation added! This is done via DTOs stored inside Shared Project.
