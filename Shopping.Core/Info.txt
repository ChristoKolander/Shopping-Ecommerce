Info Core Project 

Last updated: 2024-12-20

1. Dependencies - 
   On the Shared Project because 2 DTOs are needed for interface construction: CartItemToAddDto and CartItemQtyUpdateDto. 
   Also needed at the GUI level, kept them here for ease of use.  
  
2. Entities - 
   No validation added! This is done via DTOs stored inside Shared Project. But I suppose these should
   be at the Class level itself for better control.

   Note: People Entity was added late on in order to try out JSON column functionality in EF Core 8+

4. Interfaces - 
   IRepositoryBase contains a generic approach to declare interfaces for both synchronous 
   and asynchronous implementation. Personally, I don't think this generic approach around EF Core
   adds any specific value... but should the Solution grow in size, maybe some declarations might come in handy. 
   So, I am keeping them for now.
   
   The IRepositoryWrapper Interface is NOT used either at the moment.
