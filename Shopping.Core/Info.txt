Info: 

Dependencies - as you can see there's a dependency on the Shared Project because 2 DTOs are needed for
interface construction: CartItemToAddDto and CartItemQtyUpdateDto. Since these also are needed at the GUI
level I felt keeping them inside Shared Project made sense. 

On those lines I also added OrderDto and OderItemDto to this Core Project - needed for the Address Class inside
this Core Project. This keeps the Shared Project totally independent. 

Design - at the moment, Core basically is a flat storage for domain entities and needed stuff, not a lot of
domain logic - if any. So you can't really say it's a DDD pattern. But maybe I'll get there moving on. 

NotUsedRightNow - QueryResponse.cs ... but keeping this file in case I want to redo it, make it an abstract
base class used for additional CQRS-classes.
