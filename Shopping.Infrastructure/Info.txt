Info Infrastructure Project

1. Dependencies - 
   
   Only one, dependent on Core, but indirectly then also use the Shared Project for CartItemToAddDto.



2. Data/Config - 
   
   RoleConfiguration not used right now. Seeded instead, see AppIdentityDbContextSeed.cs
   CartConfiguration - could not get EF to work without removing. Don't remember why.


3. Data/Repositories -

   CartRepository - using the context directly. Not using the Generic Repository, but only ICartRepository interface implementation.
   ProductRepository - using the context directly to some extent, and the Generic Repository Interfaces implementation also.



4. GenericRepositoryRemake - 
   
   Late in development I found a nice example of an async Generic Repo on Carl Franklins Blazor Train site, 
   but could not use it, or did not understand how to - but using the APIresponses though.



5. Identity -
   
   In order to avoid adding Entity Framework Core to Core Project, I added the entity ApplicationUser to this project. It inherits
   from IdentityUser so it felt logical to do so. Hence, the ITokeService which uses ApplicationUser ended up here too.
