Info

Dependencies - Only one, dependent on Core, but indirectly then also use the Shared Project for CartItemToAddDto.
			   Interfaces inside Core are being implemented here.


Data/Repositories: 
Not happy about the inconsistency 1. Sometimes using entities, sometimes using Dtos. I need to search for recommendations and best practices. 
Too much in a hurry trying to get things to work in the beginning and did not pay attention to this. Solve it later.

Not happy about the inconsistency2. Cart-repo and Product-repo both have their own implemented interfaces, but theres also the
possibility to use the Generic Repo and these impemented interfaces. Even if its easy to read out, it also feels inconsictent.
Need to address this moving on.


NotUsedRightNow/GenericRepositorRemake: 
Late in development I found a nice example of Generic Repo on Carl Franklins Blazor Train site, 
but could not use it, or did not understand how to. 

NotUsedRightNow:
Could not get EF to work unless Removing the configuration for Cart.
Don't remember why at the moment.Keeping the file in case I use it later on. In order to test seeding of Roles, and another approach,
I uncommented RoleConfiguration. These are seeded and configured elsewhere. Keeping the file for later use.

Identity:
In order to avoid adding Entity Framework Core to Core Project, I added the entity ApplicationUser to this project. It inherits
from IdentityUser so it feels logical to do so.
