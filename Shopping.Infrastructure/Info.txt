1. Dependencies - 
   
   Only one, dependent on Core, but indirectly then also use the Shared Project for CartItemToAddDto.

2. Data/Config - 
   
   RoleConfiguration not used right now. Seeded instead, see AppIdentityDbContextSeed.cs
   CartConfiguration - could not get EF to work without removing. Don't remember why.


3. Data/Repositories -

   Trying out a Generic Interface(IRepositoryBase) in Core which then gets passed down to other Interfaces in a chain,
   IProductRepository for instance, also inheriting from RepositoryBase Abstract Class. This "chain" is
   implemented here.

   The Class RepositoryWrapper and its Interface IRepositoryWrapper is not being used right now.

   Some methods inside the repositories still use the productContext directly. 

   My preferred way is using the productContext directly...but I will keep this mixed approach for now.
 
   
4. GenericRepositoryRemake - 
   
   Late in development I found a nice example of an async Generic Repo on Carl Franklins Blazor Train site, 
   but did/do not use it - but using the APIresponses through a search.

  

5. Identity -
   
   In order to avoid adding Entity Framework Core to Core Project, I added the entity ApplicationUser to this project. It inherits
   from IdentityUser so it felt logical to do so. Hence, the ITokeService which uses ApplicationUser ended up here too.
